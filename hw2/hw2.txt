1)  cat x y > y
        The literal meaning of this command will be: concatenate contents from
        file x, then file y, and put them into file y.
        However, it will only put the content of file x into file y, the content 
        of file y will be overwritten. Because the ">" operator will truncate 
        file y before the "cat" process starts, which means that "cat" will 
        concatenate contents of x, then an empty file, and finally output them 
        into file y.
    cat x >> x
        The command means to concatenate content of x and append it back to x 
        itself.
        This will be an infinite loop. While "cat" is reading from x, it is
        appending whatever content it reads back to x itself. Which means that 
        "cat" will never reach EOF of x and be an infinite loop.

2) it adds the "x" permission to the given files. That is, the execute
    permission for files; and query/cd permission for directories.
