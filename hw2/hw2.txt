1)  cat x y > y
        The literal meaning of this command will be: concatenate contents from
        file x, then file y, and put them into file y.
        However, it will only put the content of file x into file y, the content 
        of file y will be overwritten. Because the ">" operator will truncate 
        file y before the "cat" process starts, which means that "cat" will 
        concatenate contents of x, then an empty file, and finally output them 
        into file y.
    cat x >> x
        The command means to concatenate content of x and append it back to x 
        itself.
        This will be an infinite loop. While "cat" is reading from x, it is
        appending whatever content it reads back to x itself. Which means that 
        "cat" will never reach EOF of x and be an infinite loop.

2) it adds the "x" permission to the given files. That is, the execute
    permission for files; and query/cd permission for directories.
    

4) First, we use users(1) to get list of currently logged in users, pipe 
    it to sort(1) to sort it. 
    Then use the output as the argument for groups(1) to get the groups that 
    each user is in.
    Then pipe the output to grep(1) to filter only the undergrads. 
    Then pipe output to cut(1) to cut the list of groups and only leave 
    usernames. 
    Then use tr(1) to delete the newlines to make everything in one line. 
    Finally, echo(1) the output to get a newline at the end.
