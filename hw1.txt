1) home directory is "/home/keyuz4", used command "echo $HOME"

2) UID is 47222, used command "id"

3) my group is "ugrad", used command "groups"
    alternatively, the group is also displayed using the same "id" command
    from the previous question

4) it erases the current line

5) after removing execute permission, we cannot create files in that directory,
    nor can we cd into it, "ls" or "ls -l" it

6) Hard link: after removing the original file, the contents of the file is not
        removed because there is a hard link to it. The contents are only 
        removed when all links to the file is removed.
   Symbolic link: after original file is removed, the contents of the file is
        removed and no longer accessible. This is because a symbolic link works
        like a pointer, it only "points" to the location of the file. When the
        original file is removed, the link is "broken".

7) using command "mv" on a directory is allowed. However, to "cp" a directory
    we must add the "-r" option to copy it recursively

8) The list of mounted file systems is in "/proc/mounts"
    To find out the total number of mounted file systems, we can "cat" the
    contents of that file and use "wc" to count the number of lines, that is,
        cat /proc/mounts | wc -l
    Running the above command on odin.ics.uci.edu gives the output of "85"

9) since the terminals are in /dev/pts , we can simply "ls" the directory and
    "grep" the ones that belong to us, that is,
        ls -l /dev/pts | grep keyuz4
    In this particular session, I see that my terminal is at /dev/pts/5

10) FFDC should be 11111111 11011100 in binary
    MOVE instruction is 1100101
    MUL  instruction is 1010001 01011101
